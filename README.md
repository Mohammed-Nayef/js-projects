# js-projects
simple widgets from what i've been learning recently in js âœ¨.

**Each folder contain different component/wedgit**

## 1. Count Down Timer with card flipping desing

### How to use ?
- very simple to use and customize ,by default it will count 24 hours from the moment js code runs, you can adjust count down time from CountDown/script.js line 6 .

### issues could be fixed:

1 - js code contain overhead processing (calling flip function for all digits each second)
  
2 - the animation depends on appending and creating new html elements
